# GifTastic
## Explanation
This is a page that dynamically lets you add a button onto the site and pull 10 Gifs
                                related to the new button or one of the existing buttons. The images will start off
                                still, but on click the animation of the gif will start and then on click again it will
                                go back to the still image.
